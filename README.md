# Web Maps
This repository is used as a server to host web maps.

We can visit the web maps at, for example, https://congengis.github.io/webmaps/2020/05/merge/.

The websites in branch 'gh-pages' will be published (see https://help.github.com/en/github/working-with-github-pages/about-github-pages).
